# PCA-Analysis-3D-plot

Creating a PCA analysis of the Iris data set and then create an interactive 3D plot to display the result.
PS - To get the plotly plot you need to run the notebook cell with your own credentials (reed Important Comment in the book).

## What is the point of PCA ( Primary Component Analysis ) ?

When you have a lot of features it's hard to visualize how the data is placed inside the multidimensional space. This allow to see how the data is dispatch in a lower dimensional space and it makes it easier to, for exemple, visualize clusters.
Here we squash the features of the flowers into 3 primary components because we do a 3D plot if we only want a 2D plot we would need to set the number of PCA down to 2.

The interactive plot are being done with 2 different methods : 

 - 1 - Matplotlib 
 - 2 - Plotly
 
 I will soon do a third way using the software Tableau and Python (TabPy).
